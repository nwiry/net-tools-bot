# Net Tools Bot - A simple bot for Discord

Dependencies:
- NodeJS 16 LTS

Available commands:

- `\whois ip {ip}` - Query information from an IP address
---
### Bot settings

Locate the `settings.json` file located in `src/config`.
You will find the keys: `BOT_ENABLED_CHANNEL`, `BOT_PREFIX` and `BOT_TOKEN`

- `BOT_ENABLED_CHANNEL`: Server channel ID where the bot will read commands and send messages. Leave it blank if you want the bot to read commands and send messages in any channel.
- `BOT_PREFIX`: Customizable command prefix. The default is `\`, if you change it to "!" for example, to use the `ping` command on a channel you will have to use its new prefix: `!ping`. This applies to all available commands.
- `BOT_TOKEN`: The bot token generated by Discord in the developer panel.
